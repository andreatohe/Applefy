Choose 'Add to iCloud Music Library'\r\n* Once the songs have been registered, right click again and 'Remove download', you can now stream or download the full song using your Apple Music subscription.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n----\r\nTo build the project you have to create a file called `Applefy/appkey.c`. The content must be set to the C-Code created under [Spotify Developer : My application keys](https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/).\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n----\r\nSome of the music files will not be found by iTunes and so instead of matching the file it will just upload the 5 second silent clip. This is because the song name from Spotify does not match the iTunes name. Easiest way to fix this is just remove the song and add it manually, it doesn't happen very often.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis application is in no way affiliated with, authorized, maintained, sponsored or endorsed by either Apple Inc. or Spotify. \r\n\r\niTunesÂ® is the registered trademark of Apple Inc.  \r\nSpotify is the registered trademark of the Spotify Group\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
